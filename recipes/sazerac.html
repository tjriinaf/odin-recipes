        <h2>A classic drink</h2>
        <p>This classic cocktail is named after the Rye whiskey of which it is
        usually made with. It is a very old drink, dating back to the speakeasys of New Orleans
        </p>
        <p>The trick with this drink is to coat the inside of the glass with herbsaint
            only place a drop in, and swirl it around the glass upsidedown. Too much will
            be overpowering.
        </p>
        <p>The other trick is to twist your lemon over the drink when finished. This step
            may seem trivial but the oils in the peel impart a valuable flavor.
