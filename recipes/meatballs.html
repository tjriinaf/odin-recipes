        <h1>Mom's Spaghetti and Meatballs</h1>

        <img src="../images/meatballs.jpg" alt="Some tasty meatballs">
        <h2>Mom's classic</h2>
        <p>These meatballs are really freakin good></p>
        <p>No you really don't get it. They have a good exterior from frying, and then
            finish cooking in the sauce. They melt in your mouth and make you want more
        </p>
        <p>The best part is that it's almost impossible to explain how to prepare them
            properly. The smell when the parsley and Locatelli Romano are perfectly balanced
            is something you have to experience before you can replicate.
        </p>
        <p>So get bent, or come over to my house so I can show you how they are supposed to smell</p>
